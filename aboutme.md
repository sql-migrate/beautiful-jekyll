My name is Neil Anderson. I'm a software developer. I spent a large chunk of my career working on database comparison and deployment tools at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com). Now I work on [Postgres Compare](http://www.postgrescompare.com), a product that compares and deploys Postgres databases.

I want software to be simple, fast, accurate and intuitive. This blog records the work and re-work involved in devolping Postgres Compare with those goals in mind.
