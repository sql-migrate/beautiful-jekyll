My name is Neil Anderson. I'm a software developer. I spent a large chunk of my career working on database comparison and deployment tools at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com). Now I work on a product that compares and deploys Postgres databases called [Postgres Compare](http://www.postgrescompare.com).

I want software to be simple, fast, accurate and intuitive. This blog records the work and rework involved in achieving those goals.
